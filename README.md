# Asteroid-Classification
Supervised Classification is a machine learning method that predicts the category of new data from existing data.
The objective of this notebook is to analyze data of asteroids in the solar system that are classified as either hazardous or not hazardous. 
The data set contains features of many asteroids in the solar system. Some of the features include Orbital Period, Magnitude, and Relative Velocity. 
Features such as Perihelion Distance and Eccentricity describe the shape of the orbit. The Hazardous column is True if the asteroid has been categorized as hazardous.
This notebook will compare Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine methods and find a model with the best results.
